# Code of Conduct

## Project Context

This Code of Conduct applies to all members of the **Population Information Reporting System** Scrum team.  
This project is part of the coursework specification, which involves designing and implementing a new system that allows easy access to population data and generates various reports (countries, cities, capitals, and populations).  
All contributors are expected to work collaboratively and professionally in accordance with Scrum principles.

## Our Pledge

As members of this Scrum team, we pledge to:

- Work respectfully and collaboratively with all team members.
- Follow Scrum practices, including open communication, transparency, and continuous improvement.
- Treat all individuals with respect, regardless of background, experience, or opinion.
- Uphold integrity in our academic work — avoiding plagiarism, dishonesty, or unethical behavior.
- Maintain a supportive and inclusive team culture.

We aim to create a learning environment where every member feels valued, encouraged, and able to contribute effectively to the success of the project.

## Responsibilities of Team Members

All team members share equal responsibility for maintaining this Code of Conduct.  
Specific expectations include:

- **Scrum Master:** Ensures the Code is upheld during meetings and team collaboration.
- **Product Owner:** Communicates requirements clearly and ensures respectful feedback loops.
- **Developers/Testers:** Follow professional conduct in development, testing, and reporting.

If conflicts arise, they should first be discussed respectfully within the team. If unresolved, they should be escalated to the module tutor or project supervisor.

## Data Ethics

Since the system handles population data:

- Reports generated must follow the specifications exactly (e.g., sorting by population, accurate percentages).

## Enforcement

Team members who violate this Code may be subject to team review and, if necessary, escalation to the course instructor.  
Violations include persistent disrespectful behavior, unethical practices, or failure to fulfill assigned responsibilities.
